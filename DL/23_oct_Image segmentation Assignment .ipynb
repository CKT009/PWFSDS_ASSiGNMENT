    "Difference Between Semantic and Instance Segmentation:\n",
    "Semantic Segmentation:\n",
    "Classifies each pixel into a category, but it does not distinguish between individual objects of the same category. For example, in a road scene, all pixels belonging to \"cars\" are grouped together, without identifying separate cars.\n",

    "Classifies and separates individual instances of objects within the same category. For example, in the same road scene, each car is treated as a separate entity (e.g., \"car1,\" \"car2\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "Semantic Segmentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "In an image of a street, pixels are labeled as \"road,\" \"car,\" \"pedestrian,\" or \"tree.\" All cars are grouped together under the label \"car,\" without distinguishing between different cars.\n",
    "Instance Segmentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the same street image, each car is identified as a distinct instance, such as \"car1,\" \"car2,\" etc., even though they belong to the same category.\n",

    "Semantic Segmentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Autonomous vehicles use it to identify drivable areas and obstacles.\n",
    "Medical imaging uses it to identify regions like tissues or tumors.\n",
    "Satellite imaging applies it for categorizing water, vegetation, and urban regions.\n",

    "Robotics uses it for interacting with specific objects in cluttered spaces.\n",
