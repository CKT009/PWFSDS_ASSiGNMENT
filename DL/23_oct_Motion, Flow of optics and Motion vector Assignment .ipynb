    "### Q5 Describe the concept of motion vectors in video compression and discuss their role in reducing redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In video compression, motion vectors represent the displacement of blocks of pixels from one frame to another. These vectors describe the motion of objects or regions within the video sequence. Instead of encoding each pixel individually for every frame, motion vectors enable the encoding process to represent changes by referring to previously encoded regions (or blocks) in other frames. This is a key technique in video compression algorithms like inter-frame compression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Role of Motion Vectors in Reducing Redundancy\n",
    "Exploiting Temporal Redundancy:\n",
    "\n",
    "Video sequences often have repetitive content across consecutive frames (e.g., a stationary background or slowly moving objects). Motion vectors allow the encoder to refer to regions in earlier frames that are similar to the current frame, instead of encoding all pixel values again.\n",
    "This significantly reduces the amount of data needed to represent the scene, as only the motion (displacement) and differences (residuals) are stored rather than the full image data.\n",
    "Block-Based Prediction:\n",
    "\n",
    "In video compression techniques like H.264 or HEVC, the image is divided into small blocks (e.g., 16x16 pixels). For each block in the current frame, the encoder searches for the best matching block in a reference frame (usually the previous frame).\n",
    "The motion vector is then used to indicate where this block has moved in the reference frame, reducing the need to encode the entire block again.\n",
    "Inter-Frame Compression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Motion vectors are used in conjunction with the concept of prediction frames. Instead of transmitting each frame fully, compression algorithms send a reference frame (often the keyframe) and describe subsequent frames in terms of differences relative to this reference frame using motion vectors.\n",
    "This method helps eliminate temporal redundancy, which is crucial for reducing the overall file size of the video.\n",
    "Reducing Data for Moving Objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "When objects move in the scene, the motion vectors describe their displacement, allowing the encoder to store only the motion (vector) rather than encoding the movement for every pixel.\n",
    "For regions of the video where there is no motion or minimal motion, compression algorithms can simply encode these areas as static, further reducing data.\n",
