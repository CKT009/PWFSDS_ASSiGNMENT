    "* Comparing \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Gradient Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Sigmoid: In deeper networks, Sigmoid can suffer from the vanishing gradient problem. As the input grows large (either positively or negatively), the gradient of Sigmoid approaches zero, which means that backpropagation updates become extremely small and, over many layers, effectively stop. This hinders learning in deeper layers, slowing down or even halting training.\n",
    "    * Tanh: Although Tanh also saturates for large inputs, it’s less prone to the vanishing gradient issue compared to Sigmoid because it’s zero-centered. This property helps reduce the likelihood of gradient updates accumulating in one direction. However, in very deep networks, Tanh can still suffer from vanishing gradients.\n",
    "    * ReLU: ReLU avoids vanishing gradients for positive values since its gradient is either 1 (for x>0x>0) or 0 (for x≤0x≤0). This consistent gradient helps with stable gradient flow through the network, making it particularly effective in deeper architectures. However, ReLU may lead to dead neurons (neurons that output zero regardless of the input) if many negative values are encountered, halting learning for those specific neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Convergence Speed\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Sigmoid: Due to vanishing gradients, Sigmoid often results in slower convergence, especially in networks with many layers. During training, the diminishing gradients prevent effective weight updates, resulting in a slow and sometimes incomplete convergence.\n",
    "    * Tanh: Tanh generally converges faster than Sigmoid in hidden layers because its zero-centered output better balances gradient updates. In shallower networks, Tanh can perform well, though it can slow down as network depth increases due to gradient saturation.\n",
    "    * ReLU: ReLU typically enables faster convergence because of its efficient gradient flow. By allowing gradients to remain intact for positive values, ReLU can handle larger networks with minimal degradation of gradient magnitudes. This property makes ReLU popular in deep learning architectures like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) where deep structures are common.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Final Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Sigmoid: While Sigmoid can be effective in shallow networks or output layers for binary classification, its tendency to cause vanishing gradients often reduces final accuracy in deeper architectures. Since gradient updates can be minimal in lower layers, the network might fail to learn complex patterns.\n",
    "    * Tanh: Tanh often achieves better accuracy than Sigmoid in hidden layers due to its zero-centered nature, which can stabilize learning. In shallower networks or moderately deep networks, Tanh can be competitive, achieving similar or better accuracy than ReLU in some cases where centered gradients help.\n",
    "    * ReLU: ReLU’s avoidance of vanishing gradients typically results in higher accuracy in deep networks since all layers can learn effectively. However, in cases where dead neurons become prevalent, accuracy may suffer if a significant number of neurons stop learning. Despite this risk, ReLU remains one of the most effective functions for deep learning tasks because of its stability and performance in practice.\n"
